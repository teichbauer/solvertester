0.4.9-20200423
- add verifyconfig.py for verify value for its sat-result.
0.4.8-20200422
- naming: 
    python cnfgenerator.py 8 38 -> data/cnf8-38.cnf -> 8 variable,38 clauses
    python cnf2config.py cnf8-38.cnf -> configs/config8_38.json
    python solver0.py config8_38.json-> verify/config8_38.txt
- solver0.py: also print out sats, on cmd and in file as head-line
0.4.7-20200422
- fix in cnfgenerator/gen_line and gnerate: each klause generated is now
  a set of values, no more list of values. For when testing if a list is in
  the group, it compare to the existing lists, and list comparison can result
  [1,2,3] != [3,2,1], but they should be the same. I could sort before compare,
  but now I use set in stead of list, then
   set([1,2,3]) == set([3,2,1])
  so this way no duplicates has a chance.
0.4.6-20200422
- github: created a new repo named solvertester, and
  on cmd line:
  git remote add origin https://github.com/teichbauer/solvertester.git
0.4.5-20200422
- solver0 for finding sats brutal-force way, and save the result
  as verify/config.txt
0.4.4-20200421
- fixes
0.4.3-20200421
- cnfgenerator.py can generate my own cnf file, that can be
  converted by cnf2config
0.4.2-20200421
- make sdic file from cnf files
0.4.1-20200421
- branch off solvertester for testing solvers, from solver4/0.3.158
0.3.158-20200421
- clean up a bit
- added perf_count for performance analysis, and pretty-print of that.
